# :kolena-learning-20: Metrics Guide

This section contains guides for different metrics. Metrics are used to measure the performance of a model. Each use case requires different metrics and finding the right metrics for your use case is very important to understand and compare the performance of your models. In each metrics guide, you can learn about the metric with examples, its limitations and biases, and its intended uses.
